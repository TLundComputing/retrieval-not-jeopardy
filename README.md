# Retrieval Game (not jeopardy)
## Purpose
The purpose of this software is to create simple retrieval grids for use within the classroom or other teaching environment.

## Install
There is no install required all files are available with an associated runtime. To use do the following:
* Download the latest version from the available versions
* Unzip the downloaded zip file
* Use the shortcut that is in the unzipped file (If this does not work, then continue with this list)
* Navigate to the bin folder
* Open the file "Retrieval Game.bat"

## Suggestions?
I am looking to further develop this application. Desired features? Please let me know
